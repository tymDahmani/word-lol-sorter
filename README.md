# word-lol-sorter
### a simple, quick, and easy words/characters sorter - including a cli program (rust)

## Java:
  - download the [file](word_lol_sorter.java)
  - in case you don't have java installed; then you prob need it :(
  - run it using the cmd/terminal using: `java word_lol_sorter.java`
  - done!


## rust (cli):
actually rust is way easier (ofc, cuz it's cli üòè)
  - download the [file](word-lol-sorter/target/release/word-lol-sorter.exe)
  - run it using cmd/terminal by writing the file name: `word-lol-sorter.exe`
  - done!

This code is inspired by my school project - hope it helps someone :)
